"""Maintainer approval for fork pull requests.

A pull request raised from a fork is written by someone without write
access to the base repository. Transferring it to Gerrit pushes that
content under the tool's own SSH identity, where Gerrit CI will then
execute it. This module decides whether a maintainer has authorised
that.

Why a review rather than a comment directive
────────────────────────────────────────────
On a Gerrit mirror the only usable trust signal is organisation
membership (see :mod:`github2gerrit.trust`), and the pull request author
frequently holds it. Under a comment scheme they could therefore
authorise their own change. GitHub structurally forbids approving your
own pull request, so a review carries a guarantee that a comment cannot.

The evaluation is deliberately conservative:

* the approval must come from a **trusted** association,
* it must be bound to the **current head SHA**, because GitHub only
  dismisses stale approvals when branch protection says so — without
  this an approve-then-force-push would slip through,
* a later ``CHANGES_REQUESTED`` from any trusted reviewer blocks, and
* the pull request author is excluded regardless, so a mirror
  configured to accept self-review still cannot be used that way.
