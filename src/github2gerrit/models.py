"""Events that ask the tool to look at a pull request again.

None of them changes the pull request's code, so each maps to UPDATE:
an existing Gerrit change should gain a patchset rather than a sibling.

They exist because the fork approval gate needs a **privileged** run to
notice that a maintainer has approved.  GitHub withholds secrets from
``pull_request_review`` on a fork pull request, so the approval itself
cannot be the run that acts on it (see
:func:`github2gerrit.cli._skip_unprivileged_fork_run`).

The important property is that these are *triggers only*.  They decide
when to re-evaluate, never whether to proceed: authorisation is always
re-read from the API by
:func:`github2gerrit.pr_approval.evaluate_fork_approval`.  So which
event fired, and who fired it, grants nothing — which is what lets the
comment trigger accept a comment from anybody without weakening the
gate.
