# Configuration loader for github2gerrit.
#
# This module provides a simple INI-based configuration system that lets
# you define per-organization settings in a file such as:
#
#   ~/.config/github2gerrit/configuration.txt
#
# Example:
#
#   [default]
#   GERRIT_SERVER = "gerrit.example.org"
#   GERRIT_SERVER_PORT = "29418"
#
#   [onap]
#   GERRIT_HTTP_USER = "modesevenindustrialsolutions"
#   GERRIT_HTTP_PASSWORD = "my_gerrit_token"
#   GERRIT_PROJECT = "integration/test-repo"
#   REVIEWERS_EMAIL = "a@example.org,b@example.org"
#   PRESERVE_GITHUB_PRS = "true"
#
# Values are returned as strings with surrounding quotes stripped.
# Boolean-like values are normalized to "true"/"false" strings.
# You can reference environment variables using ${ENV:VAR_NAME}.
#
# Precedence model (recommended):
#   - CLI flags (highest)
#   - Environment variables
#   - Config file values (loaded by this module)
#   - Tool defaults (lowest)
#
# Callers can:
#   - load_org_config() to retrieve a dict of key->value (strings)
#   - apply_config_to_env() to export values to process environment for
#     any keys not already set by the environment/runner
#
# Notes:
#   - Section names are matched case-insensitively.
#   - If no organization is provided, we try ORGANIZATION, then
#     GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER from the environment.
#   - A [default] section can provide baseline values for all orgs.
#   - Unknown keys are preserved (uppercased) to keep this future-proof.

# the pull request's `.gitreview`) cannot tell whether overriding the
# environment would be correcting a guess or discarding intent.
#
# Recording the derived keys answers that question.  The record lives in
# an environment variable because it describes *process-scoped
# configuration*, established once in `_load_effective_inputs` before
# the bulk `ThreadPoolExecutor` starts and identical for every pull
# request the process handles.  That is the opposite of per-pull-request
# state such as the approved SHA, which `cli.py` deliberately threads
# through return values precisely because concurrent workers would

# costs nothing if wrong; a push against it does not, and the consumer

    Priority order for server derivation:
    1. An explicit ``GERRIT_SERVER`` already in the environment (one the
       operator set, not one an earlier derivation pass exported); this
       is the host the orchestrator pushes to
    2. .gitreview host field (local file or fetched from GitHub)
    3. Per-org configuration file entry (GERRIT_SERVER)
    4. Heuristic fallback: gerrit.[org].org

    The host and the project are exported as one target: the closed-
    pull-request handler and the cleanup sweeps query them together,
    so a project resolved from ``.gitreview`` (or confirmed against its
    host) must travel with that host, not with one from a per-org file.

    Priority order for project derivation:
    1. .gitreview project field, from the same read as the host
    2. Gerrit's own project list, when ``G2G_RESOLVE_PROJECT_VIA_GERRIT``
       is enabled and the run permits Gerrit calls
    3. The GitHub repository name, every hyphen read as a path
       separator (see :mod:`github2gerrit.project_names`); a guess when
       the name has hyphens, and reported as one

    An explicit ``GERRIT_PROJECT`` already in the environment outranks
    all of these and survives :func:`apply_config_to_env` untouched, so
    the Gerrit lookup is not made in that case: its answer would be
    discarded, and the request would cost an authenticated round trip
    on every such run.

    The project matters here, not only in the orchestrator, because the
    closed-pull-request handler and the cleanup sweeps query Gerrit
    with whatever this function derives, and they run before the
    orchestrator ever resolves ``.gitreview`` itself.  Deriving the raw
    GitHub name -- ``multicloud-openstack`` for a project that is
    really ``multicloud/openstack`` -- made those queries match nothing
    and left every such change open (#441).  The Gerrit lookup is
    offered here for the same reason: those paths return before the
    orchestrator runs, so an option honoured only there would leave
    them with the guess the option exists to avoid.

    Priority order for credential derivation:
    1. SSH config user for gerrit.* hosts (checks generic and specific patterns)
    2. Git user email from local git configuration
    3. Fallback to organization-based derivation

    This function derives standard Gerrit parameters when they are not
    explicitly configured. The derivation is based on the GitHub organization
    and repository:

    - gerrit_ssh_user_g2g: [org].gh2gerrit
    - gerrit_ssh_user_g2g_email: releng+[org]-gh2gerrit@linuxfoundation.org
    - gerrit_server: gerrit.[org].org
    - gerrit_project: From the repository's .gitreview, else guessed from
      its name (see :func:`derive_gerrit_parameters_detailed`)

    Derivation behavior:
    - Default: Automatic derivation enabled (G2G_ENABLE_DERIVATION=true by
      default)
    - Can be disabled by setting G2G_ENABLE_DERIVATION=false

    Args:
        cfg: Configuration dictionary to augment
        organization: GitHub organization name for derivation
        repository: GitHub repository in owner/repo format (optional)
        save_to_config: Whether to save derived parameters to config file
        mark_derived: Whether to record the derived keys as provenance
